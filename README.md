Welcome to **intershop.github.io**! 

This repository contains XSD (XML Schema Definition) files that facilitate the creation of XML files.

## Semantic Versioning

Newer versions of the XSD files follow semantic versioning principles and include the keyword `semantic`. Each XSD file's namespace specifies its version.
Additionally, you can find XSD files for former versions, so you can identify the differences between versions.


## Available XSDs

The following XSDs are available:

| File Location       | Target Namespace                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| xml/ns/semantic     | `https://www.intershop.com/xml/ns/semantic`    |
| xml/ns/enfinity/6.4 | `http://www.intershop.com/xml/ns/enfinity/6.4` |

Happy coding! ðŸš€
