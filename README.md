## Intershop XSD

Welcome to **intershop.github.io**! This repository contains XSD (XML Schema Definition) files that facilitate the creation of XML files for defining process chains. Process chains are a mechanism for automating the sequential execution of interdependent scheduled jobs or pipelines in Intershop Commerce Management.

For more information on process chains and their usage, refer to the following document in the Intershop Knowledge Base: 
- [Overview - Process Chains](https://support.intershop.com/kb/index.php/Display/2784F3)

### Semantic Versioning 
Newer versions of the XSD files follow semantic versioning principles. Each XSD file's namespace specifies its version.
Additionally, you can find XSD files for former versions, so you can identify the differences between versions.

### Available XSDs

The following XSDs are available:

| File Location       | Target Namespace                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| xml/ns/semantic     | `https://www.intershop.com/xml/ns/semantic`    |
| xml/ns/enfinity/6.4 | `http://www.intershop.com/xml/ns/enfinity/6.4` |

Happy coding! ðŸš€
